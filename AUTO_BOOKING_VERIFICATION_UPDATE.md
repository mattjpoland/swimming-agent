# Auto-Booking Verification Update

## Overview
The auto-booking system has been updated to verify that bookings are actually successful before marking them as complete. This ensures that if the LLM agent gets confused or fails to complete a booking, it will get multiple retry attempts.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Booking Verification**
- After the agent completes its booking attempt, the system now verifies that an appointment actually exists for the target date
- Target date is always **one week from the current day** (e.g., Saturday's run books for next Saturday)
- Only verified bookings update the "last success" timestamp

### 2. **Smart Retry Logic**
- If a booking attempt fails (agent confusion, timeout, etc.), the last success timestamp is NOT updated
- This allows subsequent CRON runs to retry the booking
- Each user gets multiple chances per night to successfully book their lane

### 3. **How It Works**
```
1. CRON job runs (e.g., at 12:01 AM)
2. System checks if user already has a successful booking today
3. If not, sends booking command to agent (for date 1 week out)
4. Agent attempts to book the lane
5. System verifies booking exists for target date
6. Only if verified: Updates last success timestamp
7. If not verified: Leaves timestamp unchanged for retry
```

### 4. **Configurable Booking Window**
The system now supports configurable booking windows to accommodate MAC scheduling changes:

- **Environment Variable**: `MAC_BOOKING_DAYS_AHEAD`
  - Default: `8` (for 9 PM booking window)
  - Set to `7` for the old midnight booking window

**How it works:**
- **9 PM booking (current)**: At 9 PM on day X → book for day X+8
- **Midnight booking (old)**: At 12 AM on day X → book for day X+7

To change the configuration, set the environment variable:
```bash
# For 9 PM booking window (default)
MAC_BOOKING_DAYS_AHEAD=8

# For midnight booking window
MAC_BOOKING_DAYS_AHEAD=7
```

### 5. **Benefits**
- **Reliability**: Failed attempts don't block future attempts
- **Fairness**: Users aren't penalized if the agent gets confused
- **Verification**: Only actual successful bookings count as "success"
- **Multiple Attempts**: CRON can run at 12:01, 12:10, 12:20, etc. for retries

### 6. **CRON Schedule Example**
```cron
# Multiple runs to handle failures and system load
# All times in ET (Eastern Time)
1 21 * * * /path/to/curl/command  # First attempt at 9:01 PM ET
10 21 * * * /path/to/curl/command # Retry at 9:10 PM ET
20 21 * * * /path/to/curl/command # Retry at 9:20 PM ET
30 21 * * * /path/to/curl/command # Retry at 9:30 PM ET
40 21 * * * /path/to/curl/command # Final retry at 9:40 PM ET
```

### 7. **Admin Interface Updates**
- Shows last successful booking timestamp for each day
- Green = Successfully booked today
- Red = No successful booking today yet
- Info box explains the one-week advance booking system

### 8. **User Dashboard Updates**
- Clarifies that `{date}`
